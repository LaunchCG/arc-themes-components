# usePhrases

The `usePhrases()` hook simplifies the required imports and de-duplicates logic shared by all the blocks in the current repo. It replaces having to look up the `locale` from `fusion:properties` and the `arcSite` from `fusion:context` every time you need the internationalization phrases.

This does not change the existing translation implementation in any way. It only simplifies the import requirements.
