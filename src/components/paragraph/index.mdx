import { Meta, Story, Controls } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as IndexStories from "./index.stories";

import Paragraph from "./";

<Meta of={IndexStories} />

# Paragraph

Outputs a paragraph of text. Allows for plain text as well as text with HTML markup. Provides for truncation as well.

If the text you are trying to output has HTML entities within it you will not be able to
use the `{children}`. You will need to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to overcome a
limitation with JSX

## Usage

```jsx
import { Paragraph } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => <Paragraph>Text to output</Paragraph>;
```

## Properties

<Controls />

## Stories

### Default

<Story of={IndexStories.Default} />

### Output with embedded HTML\*\*

<Story of={IndexStories.OutputWithEmbeddedHtml} />

### Truncation at two lines\*\*

<Story of={IndexStories.TruncationAtTwoLines} />

### Truncation at three lines\*\*

<Story of={IndexStories.TruncationAtThreeLines} />
