# Pill

By default, the Pill component will render a span for use often with backgrounds. If an href is passed as a property, the `<Pill>` will instead render as a simple hyperlink for internal navigation. This is not intended for use for external navigation. If you desire this functionality, please utilize the &lt;Link /&gt; component as a wrap to the `<Pill>`.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Pill } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<Pill>Sports</Pill>
			/* ... */
		</>
	);
};
```

```jsx
import { Pill } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<Pill href="./sports">Sports</Pill>
			/* ... */
		</>
	);
};
```
