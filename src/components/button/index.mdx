# Button

A Button represent a clickable element that is generally found within forms for submitting and resetting.

Buttons are generally used for actions such as "Show More", "Save", "Cancel" - when a user activated the button involves an action to be taken.

In the cases where a Button's appearance is needed but the intention is to take the user to another page use the `href` prop to have the visual appearance of your button but using an `a` link.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Button, Icon } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => (
	<Button
		iconLeft={<Icon name="User" width="24" height="24" />}
		iconRight={<Icon name="ChevronDown" width="24" height="24" />}
	>
		My Account
	</Button>
);
```

### Using ref

The `Button` component uses React's [forwarding refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) technique for automatically passing a ref through a component to one of its children

```jsx
import { Button } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const ref = React.createRef();
const Feature = () => <Button ref={ref}>My Account</Button>;
```

## Properties

<Controls />

The `Button` component also allows for other properties to passed in and added to the `Button`.

## Accessibility

### Labelling

The `Button` component provides some props for accessibility concerns

The prop `accessibilityLabel` adds an `aria-label` attribute, which can accessed by assistive technologies. The primary use case for use this property is when

- The button's visible text does not provide adequete meaning
- The button has no text - when using only an icon to convey meaning

### Disabling

The prop `disabled` uses the `aria-disabled` attribute on a `button` to provide assistive technologies the ability to still access the `button` in the tab order, but provide context to the users of assistive technologies.
When using the `disabled` property any events will need to account for preventing the event completing.
