# LazyLoad

The `LazyLoad` component is used to add lazy-loading functionality to any valid React component by wrapping the target component as a child. This allows the child component to only load once the reader has scrolled to within a certain threshold of the component. Once they have passed this threshold while scrolling, the child component will by loaded.

## Lazy Loading

This component uses [`lazy-child`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazy-child) which has a dependency on IntersectionObserver which is not supported in all browsers [see support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver) - if you need to support browsers that do not have IntersectionObserver you will need to use a polyfill. The IntersectionObserver polyfill is already included with the theme blocks output types.

The lazyOptions param object allows for checks against the bottom, left, right and top.
The default is 0 for all 4 options. By adjusting those values, you can force an image to load sooner or later as it approaches the viewport. You also have an option of specifying a custom `throttle` prop that allows you to modify the rate at which the scroll value is recalculated.

# Use

Import it into a block:

```
import { LazyLoad } from '@wpmedia/arc-themes-components';

...

const ChildComponent = () => <div id="test-child-component" />;

<LazyLoad
  enabled={true}
  offsetTop={200}
  offsetBottom={200}
  offsetLeft={0}
  offsetRight={0}
  throttle={50}
>
  <ChildComponent />
</LazyLoad>

...

```
