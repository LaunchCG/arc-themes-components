# Badge

Badges are used to display a small amount of color-categorized content. Badges are not interactive
like a `<Pill>` component, but differ in appearance with the chosen "variant" property.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Badge } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => <Badge>Badge Component</Badge>;
```

## Properties

<Controls />

## Stories

### Badge

<Canvas of={IndexStories.DefaultBadge} />

### Badge Variants

<Canvas of={IndexStories.BadgeVariants} />
